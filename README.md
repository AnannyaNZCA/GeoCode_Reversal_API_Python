# GeoCode_Reversal_API_Python

This is an example of reveres geocoding where i used IQLOcation API to convert latitude/longitude to a physical address

I have to load the packages i am going to use in this script. We need a API key to authenticate each request made to Location IQ API, so pls apply for that first.
